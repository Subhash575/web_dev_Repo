# Middlewares
In Express.js, **middleware** refers to functions that have access to the
request object (`req`), response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks, such as 
1. Modifying the request or response objects.
2. Ending the request-response cycle.
3. Calling the next middleware function in the stack.
