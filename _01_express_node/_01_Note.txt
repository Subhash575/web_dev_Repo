##Some "imp" pt:-
# A port is a numerical identifier used to defferentiate multipe services or applications
running on single computer or network.
We can create multipe index1, index2.js etc file and run the program on different
port for ex: 3001, 3002, 3003 etc simultaneously and access all this using
localhost:3001, localhost:3002  etc in this way were name same but port different.

app.listen(3000);
This code infinitly listen specify port so that it exceute the request come to that
port. Therefore it is important to listen infinitly so that any request can not be leave
unserve.(This what will happen in google, facebook when you try to find some thing)
If their port is not infinitly listening it will miss the request.

#localhost is another domain name very similar to google.com
#If you "ping localhost" it will return the IP of your machine.
It looks like you're pinging ::1, which is the IPv6 loopback address
(equivalent to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4).
Here we get IP in IPv6 format which is -> ::1

##If you ever want to access your own machine from your own machine
We can either write localhost/IP(127.0.0.1) in "postman"
ex: http://localhost:3000/
ex: directly we can write-> localhost:3000/
ex: for we can also use underline IP:-   127.0.0.1:3000  or http://127.0.0.1:3000

after 3000 we use endpoint '/'
which will send "Hello World"

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

//route handlers
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000); //which port

Remember above code need to running so that postman give the result of above code.

#Some more points:-
There are some default port:-
which is :-
HTTP:- 80
HTTPS:- 443
SSH:- 22
etc.
If you deploy your project on different port then user need to specify port on your
website ex: https://game.com:3000 here we deploy the project on the AWS on port 3000
bcs of that user need to specify the port number if you deploy the project on the port
443 then user not need to mentain the port number bcs it will bydefault go on the 443
port.
Therefore it is recommanded to use the default port so that user experience become good.

## cli for local machine, express is use for creating HTTP server and you can deploy
it on the AWS so that everyone can use it.
