##myNotes:-
#dependencies-> Things which you need during your code running.
#Dev dependencies which you need only during development.
->Both dependencies some what same at high level.

Node.js provides you some packages out of the box. Some common ones include
1.fs - Filesystem
2.path - Path related functions
3.http - Create HTTP Servers (weâ€™ll discuss this tomorrow)

-> File system/fs is the "internal package" provide by the node.js.
->When we run "npm install chalk" we get the dependencies locally.
->That dependencies will added in the package.json in the dependencies section.

->Bcs dependencies is added in the "dependencies section of project.json" it will easy to 
->keep track of all your dependencies bcs all dependencies will added in this section.
##Another important pt:-
->Node_modules is the heavy folder bcs when you install any library it will depend on
some other library therefore some other library dependencies is also install in the
node Node_modules in these way Node_modules will become very heavy also remember each
dependencies/library has it own package.json were you can see the dependencies.
In this way nested dependencies make the Node_modules heavy
Remember yo don't push Node_modules on the Github it is the bad pratices instead
you push the other file like package.json, package-lock.json and index.js.
bcs if you run the command:- npm install it will automatically scan package.json and
install dependencies on your directory.
If you give this 3 file for ex:- package.json, package-lock.json and index.js bcs
package.json automatically add the dependencies on there directory when they run
the command:- npm install
In this way your friend work on the same project and check it.
