##Some more notes##:-
(imp):--->
#Every project we need to intialize for this we need to run some command first before
start writing the code.
#Here we initialize the Node.js project:-
command:- npm init -y
This command will create the "package.json" file
->Every language have "package.json" type of file.

-------(#important for understanding)------
#In the package.json there is "script"
you can able to edit the script in package.json
for ex:- "start" : "node index.js"
if you write command:- node run start
->It will execute the "node index.js" in the script.
->In this way we can edit the script and we need to give them discriptive/meaningful name.

-->This all four are the "meta data".
Not worry about unless deploy package on npm registery./deploying an external package
to the npm registery.

-----(#important also)----------------

"dependencies": {
    "chalk": "^5.4.1"
  }

->This dependencies section is important as script section.

npm:- Node Package Manager
->It manage the (dependencies/library/external-packages) these all three are same
->In npm package refer as external-package/external-dependencies.
#Every language have it own package Manager.

##dependencies:- It is the reusable code that other smart developer have return it.
->Here we bringing it to our codebase/Node.js codebase

##For installing external dependencies command:- npm install libraryName
ex:- npm install chalk

#-> npm registery:- A place were people register there external packages.

#Whenever you install any external library you can see it some were on npm registery on
the internet and read about it. sit name is: npm.js
