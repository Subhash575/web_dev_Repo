# Headers
HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between a `client` (like a web browser) and a `server` in an
HTTP request or response. They convey metadata about the request or response, such as content type, 
auth information etc.

**Common headers**
1. Authorization (Sends the user auth information)
2. Content-Type - Type of information client is sending (json, binary etc)
3. Referer - Which URL is this request coming from

(imp point): When we send request to the server than extra information is send to the server in the header our
authentication data(cookie) it will automatically send by the browser(client) so that server is able to
remember which person is that.
