##All are important stuff to know ##:-
# For running js in the terminal we use the command:- node index.js.

#On the server/terminal some what same.
#Node.js is javascript runtime work on V8 engine.
Node.js is introduce so that we can run javascript not on the frontend as well as backend.

#All Node.js code is called backend code which we are going to write.
Backend code has some extra access. Backend code can access file on your system
->"fs library" not present/access on frontend/Browser
->You cannot give file system access inside the Browser because of security concern.
for ex:- If google chrome developer have access over my file they can read my private
data.

#document variable /DOM make sense on the Browser but doesn't make sense on the Node.js 
bcs when we write code on Node.js It running on my "machine/server" and there is no UI 
associated with it. Ex:- index.js
Node.js--> core engine is V8 interperet your javascript.
#Every Browser has it own engine like V8. V8 is most popular engine.

#Like "Node.js", "Bun" is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side.
->Bun is competing with Node.js. Bun is writing in language called ZIG is low-level language like Rust.
->Bun is faster than Node.js bcs of many reason
-->Most good project depend on Node.js.

#ECMASCRIPT:- It is the javascript standard. 
->Node.js, Bun and google chrome/safari etc follow the ECMASCRIPT standard
->internet Explorer not follow this standard. Therefore internet Explorer is rearlly
use today and it is the Microsoft Product.
